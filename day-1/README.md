First day of SICP learning. Maybe 3rd attempt to do it all? Let's see how it goes this time.

# Configure VSCode for Racket development

1. Install the Magic Racket extension
2. Open the JSON settings in VSCode
3. Put the following lines of code in the JSON doc

   ```json
   "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "[racket]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "evzen-wybitul.magic-racket"
    }
   ```
