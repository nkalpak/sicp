I thought this one would be very hard, and my brain was breaking and didn't want to do it really, but
I told myself: I'll just do it for 30 minutes and if I can't get it done, I'll see the solution.
Then I got it done in about 25.

Initially I was trying to exhaust the list before I begin any squaring:

```
squares (1 2 3)
    squares (1 2)
        squares (1)
            1
```

Here you just get 1 at the end. This is because the result is never merged with anything,
so it becomes whatever the final recursive call yielded (flashbacks to tree traversal algorithms in college).

So then I figured out I have to append somehow, found the `append` function to merge two lists together
and started pseudocoding:

```
squares (1 2 3)
    append ???
```

I couldn't figure it out at this point because I was still waiting to square until I reach the base case.
Basically, you have to square at the base case but you also have to square before that. So then it got to me:

```
squares (1 2 3)
    append (square 1) (squares 2 3)
        append (square 2) (squares 3)
            9
```

Since `append` is for merging two lists, let's do `cons` instead to prepend `square (first xs)`
with the recursive call. New minor issue now is that the terminal recursive call yields a number
rather than a list, and `cons 1 2` yields `(1 . 2)` as an invalid `cons` call.

So we coerce the terminal call to a list by adding the element to an empty list:

```
cons (square (first xs)) `()
```

And that's it!!
